This is the Matlab version of test suite for the Special Session on Large Scale
Global Optimization for 2010 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence.


Code Structure
==============
readme.txt:        this file
demoEA.m:          a demo program (random walk) to show how to use the test 
                   suite
benchmark_func.m:  main program to compute the fitness values for all functions
datafiles:         shift and rotation data used by benchmark_func.m
javarandom:        the Java random generator for generating shift and rotation 
                   data, not used in this Matlab version.


Testing
=======
The test suite has been tested on Windows/Linux OS with Matlab 7.x.

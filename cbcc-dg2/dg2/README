This directory contains all the necessary files for running the differential
grouping algorithm 2 on the CEC'2010 and CEC'2013 benchmark suites and to
analyze its output. This program is based on the following research papers:

 - adjmatrix2010.m,
   adjmatrix2013.m
       these scripts generate the adjacency matrix of ideal interactions for
       the CEC'2010 and CEC'2013 benchmark suites. The adjacency matrices
       are needed for the calculation of the rho-metrics. These are not
       used by DG2.


 - analyze2010.m, 
   analyze2013.m
       these functions can be used to analyze the output of differential
       grouping. Their output contains information about the number of
       non-separable groups, number of separable variables, the total
       evaluations needed, and the grouping accuracy as measured by the
       rho-metrics (see [3]). A sample output of this program and its
       explanation is given later in this file.
               
       USAGE: analyze2013([1:15], './results/2013', './cec2013');

 - cec2010,
   cec2013
      directories containing the CEC'2010 and CEC'2013 benchmark suites.

 - dsm.m
       the design structure matrix function. Takes the output of the ISM
       function and generates the Theta matrix. See [1] for details.

 - findConnComp.m
       an implementation of the connected components algorithm to form
       the groups based on the Theta matrix generated by DSM. This is used
       internally by the dsm.m.

 - ism.m
       the interaction structure matrix function. Takes the function and
       its bounds and generates the Lambda matrix which will be used by
       the DSM function. See [1] for details.

 - README  
       this readme file.

 - results
       the output of differential grouping is saved in this directory.

 - run.m
       this file should be executed to start the differential grouping
       algorithm.

 - rho_metrics.m
       this function takes the ideal Theta matrix and the one generated
       by DG2 to calculate the rho-metrics. See [3] for more details about
       this metric.

 - run2010.m,
   run2013.m
       runs the DG2 algorithm on the CEC'2010 and CEC'2013 benchmarks
       respectively.

This table shows how each group of non-separable variables discovered
by differential grouping is formed. Each column represents a permutation
group as defined in the CEC'2010 or CEC'2013 suites. Each group contains a
predetermined set randomly chosen decision variables. Each row shows the
size of the groups formed by DG2 as well as the permutation groups the
variables belong to. For example G03 is the third group formed by DG2 and
it contains 25 decision variables which belong to the last permutation group.

This directory contains all the necessary files for running the 
DECC-DG algorithm which is a cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm
that uses differential grouping for forming the subcomponents of 
the co-evolutionary framework. 
This program is tested with the CEC'2010 and is based on the 
following research paper:

Files and directories:
----------------------
 - benchmark       : this directory contains the necessary files for the
                     CEC'2010 benchmark problems.
 - decc.m          : this file is an implementation of a cooperative
                     co-evolutionary framework.
 - dg              : this directory contains the differential grouping
                     datafiles and algorithm.
 - diff_grouping.m : this function is used to read the differential grouping
                     datafiles and form the subcomponents which are used
                     by the cooperative
                     co-evolutionary framework. This function is called
                     in decc.m.
 - README          : this readme file.
 - result          : the experimental results are stored in this
                     directory. The recorded statistics are best of all runs,
                     mean, and standard deviation.
 - runcompe.m      : sets the search domain for different functions.
 - run.m           : this file can be used to run the DECC-DG algorithm.
 - sansde.m        : the subcomponent optimizer based on SaNSDE.
 - trace           : this directory contains the intermediate results which
                     can be used for drawing convergence plots and further
                     analysis.

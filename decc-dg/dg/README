Number of non-separable variables correctly grouped: 50
=========================================================================================================================

This table shows how each group of non-separable variables which is
discovered by differential grouping is formed. The labels P1-P20 represent
the permutation groups which are defined in CEC'2010 and each group contains a
set of 50 randomly chosen decision variables (their indices). Each row of the
table shows the size of the group which is formed by differential grouping,
and shows that the variables in each group belong to which permutation
group. For example G06 is the sixth group formed by differential grouping
and it contains 50 decision variables which belong to the first permutation
group (P1). Another example if G01 with 145 variables. The variables in
this group belong to multiple permutation groups for example 8 variables
belong to P2, 9 to P3 and P4, 4 to P5 and so forth. Since F4 from CEC'2010
benchmarks contains only one non-separable group with 50 variables, the
output shows that this non-separable group is correctly identified as G06,
but the reason that eight more non-separable groups are formed is because
the algorithm mistakenly grouped some separable variables together as
non-separable variables.

An example of a perfect grouping is given below:
